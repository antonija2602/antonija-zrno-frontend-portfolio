## Features

1. Show/Hide Menu:
Toggles the visibility of a navigation menu when clicking on the menu toggle button (navToggle).
Hides the menu when clicking on the close button (navClose).

2. Remove Menu Mobile:
Removes the mobile menu (show-menu class) when clicking on any navigation link.

3. Add Blur to Header:
Adds a "blur-header" class to the header when scrolling down more than 50 pixels, providing a visual effect.

4. EmailJS Integration:
Handles the submission of a contact form (contactForm) using the EmailJS service.
Displays a success message when the email is sent successfully.
Clears the form and displays an error message in case of failure.

5. Show Scroll Up:
Toggles the visibility of a "scroll-up" button when scrolling down more than 350 pixels.

6. Scroll Sections Active Link:
Highlights the corresponding navigation link when scrolling through different sections of the page.

7. Scroll Reveal Animation:
Uses the ScrollReveal library to animate elements on the page when they come into view during scrolling.
These features collectively enhance the user experience and add interactivity to the website. 

## Future 

1. Switch between light and dark themes:
A single button facilitates the toggling of themes based on user preferences.

2. Include and enable download for CV:
The concept is to consolidate all essential showcase elements in a single location, simplifying the user experience and streamlining the process for both users and recruiters.
